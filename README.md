### Installation
#### 0. OS and GPU Compatibility
- Linux
  - If you want to use onediff on Windows, please use it under WSL.
  - [The guide to install onediff in WSL2](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/wiki/Run-OneDiff-on-Windows-by-WSL2).
- NVIDIA GPUs
  - [Compatibility with Nvidia GPUs](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/wiki/Compatibility-with-Nvidia-GPUs).


#### 1. Install torch and diffusers
**Note: You can choose the latest versions you want for diffusers or transformers.**
```
python3 -m pip install "torch" "transformers==4.27.1" "diffusers[torch]==0.19.3"
```

#### 2. Install a compiler backend
When considering the choice between OneFlow and Nexfort, either one is optional, and only one is needed.

- For DiT structural models or H100 devices, it is recommended to use Nexfort.

- For all other cases, it is recommended to use OneFlow. Note that optimizations within OneFlow will gradually transition to Nexfort in the future.

##### Nexfort
Install Nexfort is Optional.
The detailed introduction of Nexfort is [here](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/tree/main/src/onediff/infer_compiler/backends/nexfort#readme).

```bash
python3 -m  pip install -U torch==2.3.0 torchvision==0.18.0 torchaudio==2.3.0 torchao==0.1
python3 -m  pip install -U nexfort
```

##### OneFlow
Install OneFlow is Optional.
> **_NOTE:_** We have updated OneFlow frequently for onediff, so please install OneFlow by the links below.

- **CUDA 11.8**

  For NA/EU users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu118
  ```

  For CN users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu118
  ```


<details>
<summary> Click to get OneFlow packages for other CUDA versions. </summary>

- **CUDA 12.1**

  For NA/EU users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu122
  ```

  For CN users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu122

  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu122
  ```

</details>


#### 3. Install onediff

- From PyPI
```
python3 -m pip install --pre onediff
```
- From source
```
git clone https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff.git
```
```
cd onediff && python3 -m pip install -e .
```
Or install for development:
```
# install for dev
cd onediff && python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

# code formatting and linting
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

> **_NOTE:_** If you intend to utilize plugins for ComfyUI/StableDiffusion-WebUI, we highly recommend installing OneDiff from the source rather than PyPI. This is necessary as you'll need to manually copy (or create a soft link) for the relevant code into the extension folder of these UIs/Libs.

### Acceleration for production environment
#### PyTorch Module compilation
- [compilation with oneflow_compile](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl.py)
#### Avoid compilation time for new input shape
- [Support Multi-resolution input](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl.py)
#### Avoid compilation time for online serving
Compile and save the compiled result offline, then load it online for serving
- [Save and Load the compiled graph](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_save_load.py)
- Compile at one device(such as device 0), then use the compiled result to other device(such as device 1~7). [Change device of the compiled graph to do multi-process serving](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_mp_load.py)
#### Distributed Run
If you want to do distributed inference, you can use onediff's compiler to do single-device acceleration in a distributed inference engine such as [xDiT](https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT)
